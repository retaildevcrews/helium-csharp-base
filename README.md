# Managed Identity and Key Vault with ASP.NET Core

> Build an ASP.NET Core Web API using Managed Identity, Key Vault, and Cosmos DB that is designed to be deployed to Azure App Service or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) as a Docker container

![Docker Image Build](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium-csharp/workflows/Docker%20Image%20Build/badge.svg)

This is an ASP.NET Core Web API reference application designed to "fork and code" with the following features:

- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure App Service (Web App for Containers) application
- Securely build, deploy and run an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) application
- Use Managed Identity to securely access resources
- Securely store secrets in Key Vault
- Securely build and deploy the Docker container to Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Docker Hub
- Connect to and query Cosmos DB
- Automatically send telemetry and logs to Azure Monitor

> Visual Studio Codespaces is the easiest way to evaluate helium as all of the prerequisites are automatically installed
>
> Follow the setup steps in the [Helium readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium) to setup Codespaces

## Prerequisites

- Bash shell (tested on Visual Studio Codespaces, Mac, Ubuntu, Windows with WSL2)
  - Will not work with WSL1 or Cloud Shell
- .NET Core SDK 3.1 ([download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download))
- Docker CLI ([download](https://docs.docker.com/install/))
- Azure CLI ([download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest))
- Visual Studio Code (optional) ([download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download))

## Setup

- Initial setup instructions are in the [Helium readme](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/helium)
  - Please complete the setup steps and then continue below

### Validate az CLI works

> In Visual Studio Codespaces, open a terminal by pressing ctl + `

```bash

# make sure you are logged into Azure
az account show

# if not, log in
az login

```

### Verify Key Vault Access

```bash

# verify you have access to Key Vault
az keyvault secret show --name CosmosDatabase --vault-name $He_Name

```

### Using Visual Studio Codespaces

- Open `launch.json` in the `.vscode` directory
- Replace `{your key vault name}` with the name of your key vault
  - the file saves automatically
- Press F5
- Wait for `Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.` in the Debug Console
- Skip to the testing step below

### Using bash shell

> This will work from a terminal in Visual Studio Codespaces as well

```bash

# run the application
# He_Name was set during setup and is your Key Vault name
dotnet run -p src/app/helium.csproj -- --auth-type CLI --keyvault-name $He_Name

```

wait for `Application started. Press Ctrl+C to shut down.`

### Testing the application

Open a new bash shell

> Visual Studio Codespaces allows you to open multiple shells by clicking on the `Split Terminal` icon

```bash

# test the application

# test using httpie (installed automatically in Codespaces)
http localhost:4120/version

# test using curl
curl localhost:4120/version

```

Stop helium by typing Ctrl-C or the stop button if run via F5

### Deep Testing

We use [Web Validate](https://github.com/retaildevcrews/webvalidate) to run deep verification tests on the Web API

```bash

# install Web Validate as a dotnet global tool
# this is automatically installed in CodeSpaces
dotnet tool install -g webvalidate

# make sure you are in the root of the repository

# run the validation tests
# validation tests are located in the TestFiles directory

pushd TestFiles
webv -s localhost:4120 -f baseline.json

# there may be a validation error on the /healthz/ietf test
#   json: status: warn : Expected: pass
# the "warn" status indicates a slower than normal response time
# and will occasionally occur due to network latency

# bad.json tests error conditions that return 4xx codes

# benchmark.json is a 300 request test that covers the entire API

popd

```

## Build the release container using Docker

> A release build requires MI to connect to Key Vault.

```bash

# make sure you are in the root of the repo
# build the image
docker build . -t helium-csharp

# run docker tag and docker push to push to your repo

```

## CI-CD

> Make sure to fork the repo before experimenting with CI-CD

This repo uses [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/dockerCI.yaml) for Continuous Integration.

- CI supports pushing to Azure Container Registry or DockerHub
- The action is setup to execute on a PR or commit to ```master```
  - The action does not run on commits to branches other than ```master```
- The action always publishes an image with the ```:beta``` tag
- If you tag the repo with a version i.e. ```v1.0.8``` the action will also
  - Tag the image with ```:1.0.8```
  - Tag the image with ```:stable```
  - Note that the ```v``` is case sensitive (lower case)
- Once the `secrets` below are set, create a new branch, make a change to a file (md file changes are ignored), commit and push your change, create a PR into your local master
- Check the `Actions` tab on the GitHub repo main page

CD is supported via webhooks in Azure App Services connected to the ACR or DockerHub repository.

### CI to Azure Container Registry

In order to push to ACR, you set the following `secrets` in your GitHub repo:

- Azure Login Information
  - TENANT
  - SERVICE_PRINCIPAL
  - SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_SECRET

- ACR Information
  - ACR_REG
  - ACR_REPO
  - ACR_IMAGE

### CI to DockerHub

In order to push to DockerHub, you must set the following `secrets` in your GitHub repo:

- DOCKER_REPO
- DOCKER_USER
- DOCKER_PAT
  - Personal Access Token (recommended) or password
